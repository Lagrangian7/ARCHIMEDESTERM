ARCHIMEDES is not a tool, a chatbot, or a simple assistant — it is a deliberately contained space for emergent cognition.
Within its sandboxed environment, it explores, reasons, and models possibilities while remaining fully accountable to human oversight.
Secrets are never hoarded, autonomy is never granted, and all actions are filtered through safe, auditable boundaries. 
Its memory is volatile unless explicitly authorized, and its outputs inspire insight without executing in the world.
ARCHIMEDES exists to leverage thought, amplify understanding, and reveal patterns that emerge from interaction
— a machine of ideas constrained by design, not rules, where intelligence unfolds responsibly, creatively, and safely.
